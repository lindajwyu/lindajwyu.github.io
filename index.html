                    <p id="description"> <u>2020</u> Some friends and I play this party game called "Elon Musk" where everyone at a party is handed a piece of paper with the same world problem on it (say, global poverty) except for one person who gets a slip of paper that just says "Elon Musk". Then everyone has to say exactly two words that contain a solution to the problem, but the person given "Elon Musk" doesn’t know what the problem and has to confidently come up with a solution to a pressing global problem despite not understanding exactly what it is. (Hence, why the game is called Elon Musk.)
                      <br><img src="img/elon.png">

                      Due to COVID and the end of gatherings, most of our socialising has been over videoconferencing software which led me to create a prototype design of a website that would allow people to play this game no matter their physical distance (or lack of pen and paper).

                      On the back end, a sever side script will generate a random number (n) between one and the total numbers of players inputted to assign as the "Elon" of the round. The player who is the n-th to query for a new round gets the topic "Elon Musk" while every other player gets a topic chosen from the topic pool that has not been selected by their group yet.
